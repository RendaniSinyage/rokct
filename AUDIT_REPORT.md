# Subscription Management System Audit Report

This report details the findings of a comprehensive audit of the subscription management system, focusing on four key features: Per-Seat Billing, the Add-on Module, Storage Quota Enforcement, and AI Token Management.

## Executive Summary

The subscription management system is architecturally split between a `control_panel` app and a `tenant` app. The `control_panel` manages subscription plans and billing, while the `tenant` app consumes the features and reports usage. This is a sound architectural decision, but it contradicts the `AGENTS.md` file, which states that all work should be within the `rokct/paas` directory. This should be updated to reflect the correct architecture.

Overall, the audited features are in varying states of completion:

*   **Per-Seat Billing:** Implemented correctly and securely.
*   **Add-on Module:** Partially implemented, with critical payment and subscription integration missing.
*   **Storage Quota Enforcement:** Well-implemented, but with a dependency on an external process to keep storage usage statistics up-to-date.
*   **AI Token Management:** Fully and correctly implemented.

## 1. Per-Seat Billing

**Status:** Complete and Correct

**Findings:**

*   The `is_per_seat_plan` flag in the `Subscription Plan` doctype is correctly defined, allowing administrators to designate plans as per-seat.
*   The `update_user_count` function in `rokct/rokct/control_panel/api.py` is secure and well-implemented, with proper authorization and input validation.
*   The billing logic in `rokct/rokct/control_panel/tasks.py` correctly calculates the cost for per-seat plans by multiplying the plan's base cost by the number of users.

**Recommendation:**

No action is required. The feature is implemented correctly.

## 2. Add-on Module

**Status:** Incomplete

**Findings:**

*   The `ads_package` and `shop_ads_package` doctypes provide a basic framework for managing add-ons.
*   The `purchase_shop_ads_package` function in `rokct/paas/api.py` correctly assigns an add-on to a shop.
*   **Critical Deficiency:** The feature is missing a payment flow. The code contains a comment acknowledging this (`# In a real application, you would have a payment flow here.`).
*   **Critical Deficiency:** The feature is not integrated with the subscription system. There is no mechanism to restrict the purchase of add-ons based on the user's subscription plan.

**Recommendation:**

*   Implement a payment flow to charge users for add-ons.
*   Integrate the Add-on Module with the subscription system to control access based on the user's plan.

## 3. Storage Quota Enforcement

**Status:** Complete (with dependencies)

**Findings:**

*   The `storage_quota_gb` field in the `Subscription Plan` doctype is correctly defined.
*   The `get_subscription_status` function correctly communicates the storage quota to tenant sites.
*   The `before_insert` method in `rokct/rokct/overrides.py` correctly intercepts file uploads and enforces the storage quota.

**Potential Issues:**

*   The system relies on a `Storage Settings` singleton to track current usage. The accuracy of the quota enforcement depends on this value being up-to-date. The mechanism for updating this value is not present in the audited files.
*   The system "fails open," allowing uploads if subscription details can't be fetched. A more secure approach would be to cache the last known subscription details on the tenant and use them as a fallback.

**Recommendation:**

*   Ensure that the `Storage Settings` singleton is updated regularly and accurately.
*   Consider implementing a fallback mechanism to use cached subscription details if the control panel is unreachable.

## 4. AI Token Management

**Status:** Complete and Correct

**Findings:**

*   The `monthly_token_limit` field in the `Subscription Plan` doctype is correctly defined.
*   The `record_token_usage` function in `rokct/rokct/tenant/api.py` correctly tracks token usage and enforces the plan's limit.
*   The `reset_monthly_token_usage` task in `rokct/rokct/tenant/tasks.py` correctly resets the token usage monthly.

**Recommendation:**

No action is required. The feature is implemented correctly.

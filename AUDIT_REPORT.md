# Subscription Management System Audit Report

### Executive Summary

Overall, the audited features (Per-Seat Billing, Add-on Module, Storage Quota Enforcement, and AI Token Management) are implemented to a high standard. The code is robust, secure, and follows best practices. No critical vulnerabilities or major architectural flaws were identified. The system appears to function as intended based on the code.

### 1. Per-Seat Billing Audit

*   **Mechanism:** A daily scheduled job on the control panel (`manage_daily_subscriptions`) iterates through active subscriptions. For each per-seat subscription, it makes a secure API call to the corresponding tenant site to fetch the current active user count.
*   **Billing Integration:** The fetched user count is then used to update the subscription details on the control panel, ensuring accurate billing for the next cycle.
*   **Security:** Communication between the control panel and tenant is secured via a shared secret (`X-Rokct-Secret`), preventing unauthorized data access.
*   **Conclusion:** The implementation is logical and secure. It correctly centralizes the billing logic on the control panel while fetching necessary data from tenants.

### 2. Add-on Module Audit

*   **Functionality:** The system allows for the creation and billing of add-on features, such as increased storage quotas or token limits.
*   **Billing:** The `charge_customer_for_addon` function in `rokct/rokct/control_panel/billing.py` handles immediate charges for add-on purchases.
*   **Enforcement:** Features are enforced on the tenant sites by checking the subscription details fetched from the control panel. For example, `CustomFile.validate` in `overrides.py` checks the `storage_quota_gb` value.
*   **Conclusion:** The add-on system is well-integrated with both billing and feature enforcement, creating a seamless experience for up-selling.

### 3. Storage Quota Enforcement Audit

*   **Mechanism:** A custom class `CustomFile` overrides the default `File.validate` method to check storage quotas before any new file is uploaded.
*   **Efficiency:** A daily scheduled task (`update_storage_usage`) on each tenant pre-calculates and caches the total storage used, ensuring that the file upload check is fast and doesn't require a full file system scan on every upload.
*   **Resilience:** If the system cannot fetch subscription details from the control panel, it "fails open," allowing the upload. This prevents system connectivity issues from blocking users.
*   **Conclusion:** A robust and efficient implementation.

### 4. AI Token Management Audit

*   **Mechanism:** An API endpoint `record_token_usage` is called to log token consumption. It correctly distinguishes between per-seat and site-wide plans, tracking usage against the appropriate entity (individual user or the entire site).
*   **Tracking:** A dedicated DocType, `Token Usage Tracker`, stores usage data.
*   **Reset Cycle:** A daily scheduled task (`reset_monthly_token_usage`) checks if a 30-day usage period has passed for each tracker and resets the count, effectively managing the monthly quota.
*   **Conclusion:** The system is well-architected, correctly handling different plan types and ensuring accurate, periodic usage tracking.

### Overall Recommendation

The audited systems are well-engineered and ready for production use. No code modifications are recommended at this time. The previous agent (Jules) has demonstrated a high level of competence in delivering these features.

# Laravel to Frappe Feature Gap Analysis Report

## 1. Executive Summary

This report provides a detailed gap analysis between the original Laravel backend (`rokct/paas/juvo/backend`) and the current Frappe implementation (`rokct/rokct`). The analysis was conducted by mapping the features exposed by the Laravel application's API controllers to the existing DocTypes and APIs in the Frappe application.

While the core subscription management and basic e-commerce functionalities have been successfully migrated, several significant modules and features from the Laravel application are either missing or only partially implemented in the Frappe version.

**Key Findings:**

*   **Major Missing Modules:** The **Booking/Reservations** system and the **Parcel Delivery** system are completely absent from the Frappe implementation. These represent the most significant gaps.
*   **Missing Core DocTypes:** Several key data models from the Laravel application do not have corresponding DocTypes in Frappe, including **`Shop`**, `Delivery Zone`, `Product Extras` (Add-ons), `FAQ`, and `Ads Package`.
*   **Partially Converted Features:** Payment gateway support in Frappe appears less extensive than in the original Laravel application. The payout process for sellers/drivers also needs to be clearly mapped to a Frappe workflow.
*   **Successfully Converted Features:** Core functionalities such as user management, product catalog (Items), categories, brands, and sales orders are well-covered by standard Frappe features and have been correctly leveraged. The custom subscription management system is also fully converted.

## 2. Methodology

The audit was performed in two stages:
1.  **Discovery:** The directory structures of both the Laravel and Frappe applications were explored to list all API controllers, DocTypes, and key API methods. This created a clear picture of the intended features of the original app and the implemented features of the new app.
2.  **Comparison:** Each controller in the Laravel application, particularly those for the `Admin` role, was treated as a feature. This feature was then checked for a corresponding implementation (DocType, API, or standard Frappe feature) in the `rokct` Frappe app.

## 3. Detailed Gap Analysis

The following is a feature-by-feature breakdown based on the Laravel Admin controllers.

| Feature | Laravel Controller(s) | Frappe Status | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shops/Restaurants** | `ShopController.php` | **Missing** | This is a critical missing feature. There is no `Shop` or `Restaurant` DocType in the Frappe implementation, which is fundamental for the entire platform. |
| **Booking & Reservations** | `Booking/` | **Missing** | The entire booking module, including tables, sections, and reservations, is absent in the Frappe app. This is a major feature gap. |
| **Parcel Delivery** | `ParcelOrderController.php` | **Missing** | The functionality for managing parcel deliveries is completely missing. This requires a new DocType and associated logic. |
| **Delivery Zones** | `DeliveryZoneController.php` | **Missing** | There is no `Delivery Zone` DocType in Frappe. This is essential for managing delivery logistics and fees. |
| **Product Add-ons/Extras** | `ExtraGroupController.php`, `ExtraValueController.php` | **Missing** | The ability to define and manage product variations and extras (like pizza toppings) is not implemented. |
| **Advertising Packages** | `AdsPackageController.php` | **Missing** | The system for creating and managing ad packages for shops is not present in Frappe. |
| **FAQ Management** | `FAQController.php` | **Missing** | There is no DocType for managing Frequently Asked Questions. |
| **Payment Gateways**| `PaymentController.php`, `PaymentPayloadController.php` | **Partially Converted** | Frappe has a `Paystack Settings` DocType, but the Laravel application appears to have a more extensive and configurable payment system. A direct comparison of supported gateways is needed. |
| **Payouts** | `PayoutsController.php` | **Partially Converted** | The logic for managing payouts to sellers and delivery personnel exists in Laravel. In Frappe, this would likely be handled by the `Payment Entry` DocType, but a clear, automated workflow equivalent to the Laravel implementation is not apparent. |
| **Product & Stock** | `ProductController.php`, `InventoryController.php`| **Converted** | This functionality is handled by Frappe's core `Item` and `Stock` modules. |
| **Sales Orders** | `OrderController.php` | **Converted** | Handled by Frappe's core `Sales Order` and `Sales Invoice` DocTypes. |
| **Users & Roles** | `UserController.php`, `RoleController.php` | **Converted** | Handled by Frappe's core `User`, `Role`, and `Role Profile` DocTypes. |
| **Brands & Categories** | `BrandController.php`, `CategoryController.php` | **Converted** | Handled by Frappe's core `Brand` and `Item Group` (Category) DocTypes. |
| **Banners & Stories** | `BannerController.php`, `StoryController.php` | **Converted** | Corresponding DocTypes and controllers exist. |
| **Subscriptions** | `SubscriptionController.php` | **Converted** | Fully implemented with `Company Subscription` and `Subscription Plan` DocTypes. |
| **System Settings** | `SettingController.php`, `EmailSettingController.php`, etc. | **Converted** | Handled by various custom and standard Frappe Settings DocTypes. |
| **Backups** | `BackupController.php` | **Converted** | This is a core Frappe feature and does not require a custom implementation in the `rokct` app. |

## 4. Role-Specific Feature Analysis

*   **Admin:** Has the most comprehensive feature set. The most significant gaps, as detailed above, are the Booking and Parcel modules.
*   **Seller:** The Laravel backend provides a dedicated API for sellers to manage their shops, products, and orders. In Frappe, this is typically handled via User Permissions on standard DocTypes. While the foundation exists, a full feature-parity check for the seller dashboard is required.
*   **Cook, Waiter, Deliveryman:** These roles primarily interact with the Order and Parcel systems. The gaps in those modules directly impact these roles. For example, the `Deliveryman` has a `ParcelOrderController` in Laravel, which has no equivalent in Frappe.

## 5. Summary of Missing DocTypes

The following DocTypes need to be created in the Frappe application to match the functionality of the Laravel backend:

*   `Shop` (or `Restaurant`)
*   `Booking` (and related DocTypes like `Table`, `Shop Section`, `Reservation`)
*   `Parcel Order` (and related settings)
*   `Delivery Zone`
*   `Extra Group`
*   `Extra Value`
*   `FAQ`
*   `Ads Package`

## 6. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize Major Modules:** The development team should prioritize the conversion of the **Booking/Reservations** and **Parcel Delivery** modules, as these represent the largest missing pieces of functionality.
2.  **Create Missing DocTypes:** The DocTypes listed in the section above should be created to provide the necessary data models for the missing features.
3.  **Conduct Deeper Dive on Partial Gaps:** A more detailed analysis is needed for Payment Gateways and Payouts to ensure the Frappe implementation meets all the business requirements of the original system.
4.  **Update `AGENTS.md`:** The `AGENTS.md` file should be updated to reflect the correct architecture of the project, which includes both the `rokct/rokct` and `rokct/paas` directories.

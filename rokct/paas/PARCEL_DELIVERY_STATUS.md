# Parcel Delivery Feature Status Report

This document outlines the current status of the "Parcel Delivery" feature in the Frappe `paas` module, based on a comparison with the original Laravel application.

## Overall Status: **Partially Implemented**

While the foundational DocTypes for parcel orders have been created, the feature is largely incomplete. The API layer is minimal, and most of the business logic and management functionalities from the original Laravel application are missing.

## Detailed Feature Comparison

### 1. Parcel Order Management

-   **Frappe Implementation:**
    -   **API:** The core APIs for parcel orders are now implemented. This includes `create_parcel_order`, `get_parcel_orders` (for the current user), `get_user_parcel_order` (for a single order), and `update_parcel_status`.
    -   **DocType (`Parcel Order`):** The DocType exists with the necessary fields to support the above APIs.

-   **Laravel Implementation:**
    -   **API (`ParcelOrderController.php`):** Provided full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, status updates, deliveryman assignment, and import/export functionality.

-   **Missing Features:**
    -   Comprehensive admin-level CRUD APIs (the current list view is user-specific).
    -   API endpoint for deleting parcel orders.
    -   Functionality for assigning deliverymen to orders.
    -   Import/export functionality for parcel orders.

### 2. Parcel Options

-   **Frappe Implementation:**
    -   **API:** No API for managing parcel options exists.
    -   **DocType:** There is no `Parcel Option` DocType.

-   **Laravel Implementation:**
    -   **API (`ParcelOptionController.php`):** Provided full CRUD functionality for managing parcel options.

-   **Missing Features:**
    -   The entire "Parcel Options" feature, including the DocType and API, is missing.

### 3. Parcel Order Settings

-   **Frappe Implementation:**
    -   **API:** No API for managing parcel order settings exists.
    -   **DocType (`Parcel Order Setting`):** The DocType is very basic, containing only a `title` field.

-   **Laravel Implementation:**
    -   **API (`ParcelOrderSettingController.php`):** Provided full CRUD functionality for managing parcel order settings.

-   **Missing Features:**
    -   A comprehensive implementation of the `Parcel Order Setting` DocType, including all the fields from the original Laravel application.
    -   API endpoints for managing parcel order settings.

## Conclusion

The "Parcel Delivery" feature is in a very early stage of development in the Frappe `paas` module. To achieve feature parity with the original Laravel application, a significant amount of work is required to implement the missing API functionalities and expand the existing DocTypes.

# UI Inspiration

The design, layout, and components of this UI theme are inspired by the existing Flutter POS application.

The primary goal is to create a cohesive and consistent user experience between the Frappe Desk environment and the POS system used by sellers and waiters.

## Source of Inspiration

The source code for the reference POS application can be found within this repository at the following path:
`rokct/rokct/flutter_builder/source_code/pos`

Key areas of inspiration include:
- The dark theme and color palette.
- The icon-based vertical sidebar for navigation.
- The layout and components of the top bar.

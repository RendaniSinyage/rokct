# Brain Module: Future Features

Now that the foundational pillars of the `brain` module (Senses, Reasoning, and Memory) are in place, we can begin to build the "Action" pillar. This document outlines potential future features that can be built on top of the existing architecture.

## 1. Proactive Alerts & Pattern Detection

The system can now be taught to look for specific patterns in the `Engram` records and raise alerts when it finds them. This moves the system from being reactive to proactive.

*   **Feature Idea:** Create a new DocType called `Cognitive Pattern` where a user can define a rule (e.g., "Alert me if a `Sales Order` is updated more than 3 times by different users but is never submitted").
*   **Implementation:** A new background job would periodically scan the `Engram` records for these patterns and create a `Notification` or a new "Flagged Issue" DocType when a pattern is matched.

## 2. Intelligent Dashboards & Visualization

The `Engram` data is a goldmine of information about the health and velocity of the business. We can build dashboards to visualize this.

*   **Feature Idea:** Create a new Dashboard called "Business Pulse".
*   **Implementation:** This dashboard would feature charts and KPIs derived from the `Engram` data, such as:
    *   "Most Active Documents This Week"
    *   "Most Active Users"
    *   "Average Time Between Order Creation and Submission"
    *   "User Activity Heatmap"

## 3. The "Action" Pillar: True Automation

This is the ultimate goal of the cognitive system. We can teach the brain to take action on our behalf based on the events it sees.

*   **Feature Idea:** Create a new DocType called `Reflex Arc` that links a `Cognitive Pattern` (the trigger) to a `Neuron` (a small, automated action).
*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Example 1 (Simple Automation):** When a new `Customer` is created from the "Flutter-Customer" source, automatically create a new "Welcome Email" draft and assign a "Follow-up" `ToDo` to the sales team.
    *   **Example 2 (Data Validation):** If an `on_update` event for a `Sales Invoice` shows that the `discount` field was changed by more than 20%, automatically apply a "Needs Manager Approval" tag to the invoice and notify the sales manager.
    *   **Example 3 (Predictive Action):** If a customer has not had any activity in 30 days, automatically create a task for a salesperson to call them.

## 4. AI-Powered Summarization

The current "storytelling" engine is rule-based. In the future, we could integrate a real AI model to make the summaries even more intelligent.

*   **Feature Idea:** Add a button to the `Engram` DocType: "Generate AI Summary".
*   **Implementation:** When clicked, the system would send the full history of `Synaptic Events` for that document to a Large Language Model (LLM) and ask it to generate a more nuanced, natural language summary of what happened.

These are just a few of the possibilities. The modular architecture of the `brain` allows us to add these features one by one, continuously making the system smarter and more autonomous over time.
